# spelling-bee-experiments
I started playing around with "spelling bee" puzzles after getting hooked from the NYT Crosswords page. I quickly found that I could solve them with grep and bash, and could use sed to create the word list to check against.

I used the dictionary from https://github.com/sujithps/Dictionary - although I'm not clear on what license that has, or even if that version of it is legally in the clear. I can manipulate it quickly, anyway.
