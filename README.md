# simple-game-experiments
I decided to broaden the scope of my previous "spelling-bee-experiments" repository after realizing I've never added my equally primitive bash script Wordle solver. My mom got hooked on the NYT puzzle games more recently, so we've taken to playing them when we can. She thinks all these "experiments" are "cheating". 

# spelling-bee-experiments
I started playing around with "spelling bee" puzzles after getting hooked from the NYT Crosswords page. I quickly found that I could solve them with grep and bash, and could use sed to create the word list to check against.

I used the dictionary from https://github.com/sujithps/Dictionary - although I'm not clear on what license that has, or even if that version of it is legally in the clear. I can manipulate it quickly, anyway.
